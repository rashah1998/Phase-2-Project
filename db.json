The center of my steak was so frozen it started singing Let It Go. Even Chef Boyardee would be disgusted by this sorry attempt at a meal. The kitchen screwed up my order completely, mixing it up with someone else's. It took almost an hour to get it corrected! Wild horses couldn't drag me back here."
